#### Introduction
In this rapidly evolving landscape, Vancouver City FC finds itself at a pivotal
moment. Once celebrated for its passionate supporters and dynamic
performances, the club now faces mounting financial pressures and rising
expectations from its fanbase. To remain competitive, it must look beyond
traditional strategies and reimagine what it means to be a football
organization in the status quo.

In this project we attempt to help Vancouver City FC identify the most impactful strategies to grow its total revenue. With the analysis of three given datasets we were able to come up with the following:

**The Problems**

*Stadium operations:*
- Declining attendance
- Lower in stadium spending
- Limit variety
- Long wait times
- Lack of modern amenities
- Underutilization of the stadium for non-matchday events
- concerts, tournaments, and corporate bookings that could book the space leave the potential revenue unmaximized 

*Merchandise sales:*

- Inconsistent sales
- Overall volume sales declined
- Engagement outside the younger audience has weakened
- Seasonal spikes are not enough to maintain steady year-round sales
- Online stores face challenges with logistics, product variety, and limited international reach
- Shipping delays and minimal global marketing = unable to reach global audiences
- The Instadium store has lower traffic and declining attendance

*Fanbase engagement:*

*Domestic:*
- Difficulty maintaining engagement outside major cities and peak seasons
- Competing entertainment options and the rising cost of attendance 
- Need to convert casual viewers to long-term fans
- Outside of younger fans, the audience is not engaged and connected
- Reduced media coverage 
- Need to strengthen club and audience connection
-Fans interact every once in a while and need consistent interaction/loyalty

*International:*

- Limited outreach campaigns
- Language accessibility
- Lack of localized content 
-Need pathways to become active supporters: regional fan clubs, more merchandise availability

**Solutions**
*Immediate Solutions*
- Target 18-25 demographic with student pricing
- Expand international shipping for large international fanbase
- Implement mobile ordering
- Increase digital advertising through social media

*Midterm Solutions*
- Premium services development: VIP experience
- Youth development for long-term fan development
- International expansion for merchandise sales globally
- Utilize stadium on non-match days for concerts/events.

*Long Term Solutions*
- Implement eco-friendly upgrades
- Renovate sections for a specific audience (VIP, families)
- Implement stadium features, AR experiences
- Subscription-based fan boxes

**Projections**
*Projected Financial Impact:*
Year 1 target: $3.5M total revenue (~8 increase)
Year 2 Target: $5.0M total revenue (~15% increase)
year 3 target: $6.5M total revenue (~20% increase)

Based on our analysis, implementing the recommended strategies could restore Vancouver City FC to historical revenue levels within 3 years, with significant potential for further improvement. By focusing on modernization, demographic optimization, and strategic diversification, the club can achieve unprescedented growth.
